# webTest

TODO:

JS
when clicking on the button, nothing happens.

1. Implement the `getArticles` function, so it fetches the 1st page of articles
using the endpoint `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miquelmasrieramrf/webTest/main/data/articles/{ __PAGE_NUMBER__ }`
2. make the function showArticles use the articles fetched using the previous one, so they are shown in the page.
3. now show the articles of the pages 1 and 2 (articles [1, 10]) in order.

CSS

Styling is not fine
1. we want to display the articles in a vertical list
2. style the button exacly as the `article`s
3. make it response (make the articels fit in a smartphone screen)

Analysis

1. improve the showArticles function
2. html discussion
